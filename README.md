# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, December 2020

## Theme
We interpereted the theme of under pressure by making our game take place underground, and we incorporated a timer to make the player under pressure in a second way.

## Game Play
The objective of our game is to make it across the screen before the timer runs out.

## Impediments
We at first struggled with implementing the timer, and additionally we had problems uploading certain files to our repository collectively.
